# 6. Advanced Topics

This section briefly touches upon advanced topics in ZIO and Scala 3 that you might want to explore further after completing the core workshop material. These areas are crucial for building production-grade, highly scalable, and observable applications.

### ZIO Streams (Advanced)

While we've touched upon `ZStream` for concurrent processing, there's much more to explore:

*   **Stream Combinators**: Advanced operators for transforming, merging, zipping, and aggregating streams.
*   **Error Handling in Streams**: Strategies for handling errors within streams, including retries, fallbacks, and dead-lettering.
*   **Resource Management in Streams**: Ensuring proper resource acquisition and release for long-running streams.
*   **Backpressure**: Understanding how ZIO Streams automatically handle backpressure to prevent producers from overwhelming consumers.
*   **Transducers**: Efficiently composing stream transformations.

### ZIO HTTP / ZIO GRPC

For building web services and APIs:

*   **ZIO HTTP**: A functional, low-latency, and high-performance HTTP server and client library built on ZIO.
*   **ZIO GRPC**: A ZIO-native gRPC client and server implementation.

### ZIO Config

Externalizing configuration is vital for flexible deployments. ZIO Config provides a type-safe and composable way to load application configurations from various sources (e.g., environment variables, system properties, HOCON, JSON, YAML).

### ZIO Test

ZIO Test is a powerful testing framework built specifically for ZIO applications. It provides:

*   **Test Environment**: Easily inject mock or test-specific dependencies.
*   **Property-Based Testing**: Generate test cases automatically.
*   **Aspects**: Apply common test logic (e.g., timeouts, retries) to multiple tests.
*   **Test Layers**: Build test-specific environments using `ZLayer`.

### ZIO Logging

Structured, contextual logging is essential for observability. ZIO Logging provides a type-safe logging solution that integrates seamlessly with ZIO effects, allowing you to attach contextual information to your logs.

### ZIO Metrics / ZIO Tracing

For monitoring and debugging production systems:

*   **ZIO Metrics**: A library for collecting and exposing application metrics (e.g., counters, gauges, histograms) to monitoring systems like Prometheus.
*   **ZIO Tracing**: Integrates with distributed tracing systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to provide end-to-end visibility into request flows across microservices.

### Interoperability

ZIO provides excellent interoperability with existing Scala and Java libraries:

*   **`ZIO.fromFuture` / `ZIO.toFuture`**: Convert between `scala.concurrent.Future` and `ZIO`.
*   **`ZIO.fromCompletionStage` / `ZIO.toCompletionStage`**: Interoperate with Java's `CompletionStage`.
*   **`ZIO.attempt`**: Lift any side-effecting Java/Scala code that might throw exceptions into a `Task`.

### Functional Domain Modeling

Deep dive into advanced functional programming patterns for modeling complex business domains:

*   **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)**: Using `sealed trait` and `case class` to model domain entities and their states.
*   **Tagless Final / Free Monads**: Advanced techniques for building highly modular and testable interpreters for domain-specific languages.
*   **Optics (e.g., Monocle)**: Tools for immutably manipulating deeply nested immutable data structures.

### Performance Tuning and Optimization

Strategies for optimizing ZIO applications:

*   **Fiber Concurrency**: Fine-tuning parallelism levels for `mapZIOPar` and other combinators.
*   **Batching and Debouncing**: Optimizing interactions with external systems.
*   **Profiling**: Using tools like Java Flight Recorder or YourKit to identify bottlenecks.

This workshop has provided a solid foundation in Scala 3 and ZIO. The topics listed above represent the next steps in mastering ZIO for building robust, high-performance, and maintainable functional applications. Happy coding!
